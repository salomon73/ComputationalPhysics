\section{Steepest descent and conjugate gradient}

Say one has the following linear system of equations to solve:\\

\beq
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b},\label{lin_syst}
\eeq\\

\noindent where $\mathbf{A} $ is square, symmetric and positive definite, and $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{b}$ are column vectors. Then two algorithms can be used to solve the linear system from Eq.(\ref{lin_syst}), namely the steepest descent (SD) and the conjugate gradient (CG) methods. Both methods exploit the fact that solving Eq.(\ref{lin_syst}) for $\mathbf{x}$ is equivalent to extremizing the following quadratic form $\mathbf{f}$: \\

\beq
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} -\mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{c},\label{quad_form}
\eeq\\

\noindent for an arbitrary constant $\mathbf{c}$ since the gradient of $\mathbf{f}$ that we shall denote by $\mathbf{f}'$ recovers Eq.(\ref{lin_syst}):\\

\beq
\mathbf{f}'(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}.
\eeq\\

\noindent Thus, one notices that finding the values of $\mathbf{x}$ that extremize $\mathbf{f}$ is equivalent to finding the zeros of the gradient and solving Eq.(\ref{lin_syst}).\\

\begin{homeworkSection}{(1) Algorithms} 
	

The \textbf{SD} method starts from an arbitrary $\bx^{(0)}$ such that each step of the algorithm gives a point $\bx^{(i)}$ closer to the solution $\bx$. At each step, the direction of the steepest descent of the quadratic form from Eq.(\ref{quad_form}) is found and the minimum along this direction is determined, leading to the point $\bx^{(i+1)}$. Hence the resulting sequence $\{ \bx^{(i)}\}  $ is decreasing and the convergence rate of the error to the solution $\mathbf{e}^{(i)} :=\bx^{(i)}-\bx$ follows:\\

\beq
\frac{|\mathbf{e}^{(i)}|_{\bA}}{|\mathbf{e}^{(0)}|_{\bA}} \leq \Bigg(\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa+1}\Bigg)^{i},
\eeq\\

\noindent where $|\cdot |_{\bA} :=(\bx^{T}\bA\bx)^{1/2}$ and $\kappa$ is the so called condition number of $\bA$, that is the ratio of the largest singular value of $\bA$ to the lowest.\\

 
The \textbf{CG} method shares basically the same base, the only difference is that the vectors from each step are no longer orthogonal to each other, but $\bA$-orthogonal, that is $\bx \cdot \mathbf{y} = \bx^T \bA \mathbf{y}$. This condition turns out to be very efficient, in the sense that if one were to consider an ideal case without numerical imprecision, the algorithme should converge in $n$ steps, with $n$ the size of the matrix. The relative error follows Eq.(\ref{rel_CG}).

\beq 
\frac{|\mathbf{e}^{(i)}|_{\bA}}{|\mathbf{e}^{(0)}|_{\bA}}\le  \Bigg(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}-1}{\sqrt{\kappa}+1}\Bigg)^{i}\label{rel_CG}
\eeq  \\


\noindent The two algorithms have been implemented in the following scripts and the tests were passed successfully.\\
